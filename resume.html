      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>

Ultimate player in the world, dominating the competitive scene since the game's release. He is currently ranked 1st on the Mexican Ultimate Power Rankings, OrionRank 2022, and UltRank 2022. Originally playing Ike, he later found tournament success with Lucina and Wolf before picking up Joker shortly after the character's release.

He has continued to use Byleth offline and achieve major success in tournaments.</p>
      <p>Leo was ranked 3rd on the Panda Global Rankings 100 and was formerly ranked 1st on the Mexican Smash 4 Power Rankings.</p>
